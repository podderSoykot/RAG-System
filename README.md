# RAG-System
 Welcome to the RAG System project! This repository hosts a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances text generation by incorporating relevant information from external documents. By combining retrieval-based methods with generative models, our RAG system delivers accurate, contextually rich, and informative responses.
